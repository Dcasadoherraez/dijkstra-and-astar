The program is divided into:
- main.py: this is the file that contains the code that must be ran. Leave uncommented the algorithm that wants to be tested, and replace the maps as desired
- test_maps.py: contains the two maps for which the algorithm was tested on
- Astar_classes.py: contains the node and edges classes for the A* algorithm
- Astar_functions.py: contains the functions for the A* algorithm, including the A* algorithm function 
- Dijkstra_classes.py: contains the node and edges classes for the Dijkstra's algorithm
- Dijkstra_functions.py: contains the functions for the Dijkstra's algorithm, including the A* algorithm function 

NOTE: The color of the path results in the report have been edited for a better visualization. In the program, the last node will not be colored, and also the path might have a different color as presented in the report.

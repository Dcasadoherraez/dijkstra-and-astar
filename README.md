# Dijkstra’s & A* comparison for visual navigation

## Abstract 
Visual navigation is an essential task that must be resolved by modern mobile robots in order to be able to move around in their environment, specially in indoor situations in which there is no GPS or other satellite based navigation possibilities. This project will overview the two main steps of visual navigation so that the system can move from a source position to a target avoiding obstacles on its way. Chapter 2 will describe the subject dividing into two stages: exploration and path planning. The former will outline the main sensors used in robots for this type of navigation, while the latter will evaluate two possible approaches of path planning to move to a goal from an initial position. A more detailed view of this will be presented in 3, with the mathematical explanation, algorithm pseudocode, example procedure, and computer program for each of them. Due to the fact that the visual navigation problem might range from the data acquisition to the decision making step, the scope of the computer program will be limited to cover the two possible path planning algorithms, A* and Dijkstra’s, including a comparison of them and their results. Finally Chapter 4 will reference the key learnings during the project, as well as future areas of research.
